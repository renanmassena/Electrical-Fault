# Final Project - Detecting Electrical Faults

In this repository we present the final project of the Bootcamp of Data Science, Data Analytics & Machine Learning from Infnet Institute.

This is a binary classification study using a dataset from Kaggle [1] that shows the time evolution of currents and voltages of a simulated three-phase electrical system in normal and faulty state.
